# PythonWhatsappBot
That project was a training with the Python Library Selenium. 
The project consists of an automation where python opens WhatsApp web in the Chrome browser, the user logs into their account, then python writes a message and sends it to the user's own number. Then, it forwards the message to a certain number of contacts determined in blocks of 5 contacts, where at the end of each block it is interrupted after a few seconds and then goes to the next block.
